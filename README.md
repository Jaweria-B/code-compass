Ensure the `st.set_page_config` call in your `app.py` is correctly setting the title and icon:
```python
st.set_page_config(page_title="Code Compass", page_icon=":compass:")
```

### Final Notes:

- **Dependencies:** Make sure your `requirements.txt` includes all necessary libraries.
- **Images in `README.md`:** Update the URLs to actual images or replace them with your own hosted images.

- **Testing:** Thoroughly test each page to ensure it works as expected.
